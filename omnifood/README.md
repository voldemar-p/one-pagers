Front-end of a one-page website developed in 2018, during an online Udemy course [Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) by Jonas Schmedtmann.

The course was about creating a front-end of a responsive, modern website and it's main focus was on HTML5 and CSS3 with some occasional jQuery.
